 VFM_WELCOME_TEXT: "If this is your first time playing, here are a few important notes:\n\n-Subjugating or conquering states from unrecognized countries now requires a colonial law other than frontier colonialism, which limits those diplomatic plays to neighboring states.\n\n-New character roles like Vice Presidents and Prime Ministers refresh on monthly pulses. If you see a black silhouette in place of a character, it may take a month or two for them to be replaced.\n\n-Literacy rates will change one week into the game to more accurately reflect the historical situation at game start. Your starting literacy rate will likely be much lower than it is now.\n\n-Map-related gamerules must be set before the map is generated. If a gamerule you set on a previous screen does not appear to function, start a new game from the main menu with the gamerule set.\n\n-Save-breaking updates are infrequent, but they need to happen sometimes to deliver new content. Previous builds of the mod can always be found on our Paradox Mods and GitHub pages to continue your saves.\n\nThanks for playing!"
