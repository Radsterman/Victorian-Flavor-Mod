 sick_man.3.t:0 "The Suspension of the Constitution"
 sick_man.3.d:0 "The new course we have charted these last decades has clearly served the country ill. The rising tide of nationalism has not been stemmed by foolish liberalism and the Christians of the Empire have only grown more bold in their efforts to undermine us. Today the [SCOPE.sCharacter('ottoman_sultan').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] suspended the constituion and restored [SCOPE.sCharacter('ottoman_sultan').GetHerHis] absolute power over the state. The pace of modernisation will not falter, but we will bring about change in accordance with our traditional values."
 sick_man.3.f:0 "It is the view of His Sublime Majesty that the present situation of the empire is untenable, and he therefore moves to proscribe the ill-fated constitution forced upon him by feckless ministers. Effective immedietly the status of such persons is reduced to that of secretaries, and they are reminded that their function is to carry out [SCOPE.sCharacter('ottoman_sultan').GetHerHis] will. His Most Sublime Majesty has decreed it. God is Greatest!"
 sick_man.3.a:0 "The Sultan is wise indeed."
 
 sick_man.2.t:0 "Dawn of the Constitutional Era"
 sick_man.2.desc:0 "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has made great progress in governance. The abolition of the Eyalet system and the errosion of the divisions between milleti has helped to centralise power in the hands of the Sultan, who now rules over a state where all are equal as [SCOPE.sCharacter('ottoman_sultan').GetHerHis] subjects. A new era begins for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state."
 sick_man.2.f:0 "Sublime. That is the only word for it. To walk the streets of Konstantinyye and see modern factories and schools, to see the guards practicing their military drill. One people united under the House of Osman. And to think that only a few decades ago the empire was on the brink of collapse! Where once we were a people divided, now men of all faiths and nations bow before our noble Sultan. God is good!"
 sick_man.2.a:0 "The army could use additional reforms."
 sick_man.2.b:0 "We should re-conquer the Balkans!"
 sick_man.2.c:0 "Follow through with urbanization."
 sick_man.2.d:0 "We will reap the benefits of education."
 
 sick_man.1.t:0 "The Sick Man of Europe"
 sick_man.1.d:0 "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is in a tense period of reform. Conflict brews between those who would maintain the absolute authority of the Sultan and hold fast to the traditional structures that have seen us through these past centuries, and those who would usher them out in the name of modernity and create a society where all are equal as subjects of the House of Osman. Our recent dealings with the Russians have made our relationship with Britain precarious, and it becomes clear that domestically and internationally we walk a thin tightrope, fail to tread carefully and you inivte disaster..."
 sick_man.1.f:0 "The Sultan favours the reformists and so onwards we shall forge. In the Auspicious Incident we destroyed the Janissaries who had maintained their grip on power for centuries, finally removing a major obstacle to remaking the Ottoman state. There is much more to do. The army must be professionalised, the navy restored, the Eyalets replaced and the Millets reined in. The Pasha of Egypt must be disciplined, our control over the Levant restored, Russian gains in the Caucasus reversed and the gnawing demands of the Christian powers to interfere in favour of our discontented minorities resisted. Hold fast and with luck and patience you may yet set the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state on the path to glory once again!."
 sick_man.1.a:0 "Let us see what the future holds."
 
 je_sick_man_main:0 "The Sick Man of Europe"
 je_sick_man_main_reason:0 "An era of change and reform has begun for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], though for good or ill remains to be seen."
 je_sick_man_main_goal:0 "Complete 8 'Tanzimat' [Concept('concept_journal_entry', '$concept_journal_entries$')]"
 
 je_sick_man_syria:0 "Tanzimat: Reclaim Syria"
 je_sick_man_syria_reason:0 "Syria has fallen under the de-facto control of the ambitious Pasha of Egypt, who seeks to usurp our imperial power. We must drive his armies back to Egypt and put him in his place."
 je_sick_man_syria_status:0 "Starting a diplomatic play against Egypt will give European [Concept('concept_great_power', '$concept_great_powers$')] an [concept_active_interest] in the region."
 
 je_sick_man_egypt:0 "Pacify Egypt"
 je_sick_man_egypt_reason:0 "With Syria recaptured, Egypt can be restored to its proper place. We can either launch a military campaign to subjugate this rebellious vassal, or seek an accord with Ali Pasha."
 
 je_sick_man_economy:0 "Tanzimat: Economic Growth"
 je_sick_man_economy_reason:0 "Our economy is largely agrarian and deeply rural. This suits the purposes of our conservative local Beys and Sanjaks as well as the clergy of the various milleti, who largely subsist on rents and fees extracted from peasants, it does not provide a suitable foundation for a modern power. We should expand manufacturing and our urban centres."
 je_sick_man_economy_goal:0 "Double your GDP."
 
 je_sick_man_education:0 "Tanzimat: Education Reform"
 je_sick_man_education_reason:0 "A principal problem facing our agenda of reform is the lack of educated and lettered men amoung our population. This stymies our efforts to create not only a modern economy and military, but also to break down the cultural barriers between our diverse population. This problem is especially accute in our Muslim subjects, leading to a Christian and Jewish middle-class dominating economic life in many of our cities. The establishment of educational institutions and the growth of literacy must be a top priority."
 je_sick_man_education_goal:0 "Increase the literacy rate of your people by 25%."
 
 je_sick_man_separatism:0 "Tanzimat: Suppress Sectarian Conflict"
 je_sick_man_separatism_reason:0 "Clashes between the Raya and Turks have increasingly undermined our government as well as giving foreign countries an excuse to interfere in our local politics. On the back of sectarian unrest and European interference did we lose our grip on Greece, Serbia and the Romanian Principalities. We must calm such tensions and prevent them from escalating if we wish to avoid further losses."
 je_sick_man_separatism_goal:0 "The following must be true for 15 total years:"
 
 je_sick_man_army:0 "Tanzimat: Army Modernization"
 je_sick_man_army_reason:0 "Though the Janissaries have been destroyed, there is far more that must be done to modernize our armed forces. We must create a professional army and ensure its discipline holds, lest it contribute to internal unrest and undermine reform. We presently also rely heavily on Kurdish irregulars for garrison duty and the enforcement of our will throughout the Levant, however their brutality and fierce devotion to Islam is a hinderance as often as it is a help. Creating a disciplined, loyal and modern army will not be easy, but it will be worth it."

 je_sick_man_bureaucracy:0 "Tanzimat: Bureaucratic Reform"
 je_sick_man_bureaucracy_reason:0 "Our bureaucracy is a patchwork of archaic laws and systems, with corrupt, autonomous Beys barely exerting control over the Empire's provinces. If we are to overcome the many challenges to our rule, we must modernize our administrative system."
