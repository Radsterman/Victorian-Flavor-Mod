They plan on using Khorasan as a base for their operation and thus requested us to supply troops to their cause. In turn, we’d be granted independence and be allowed to carve out a state of our own in Khorasan.\n\nShould this plot fail however, it is very likely that the Qajars will retaliate and abolish our Khanate for good."
