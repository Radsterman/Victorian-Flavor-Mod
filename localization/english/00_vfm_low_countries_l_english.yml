 je_treaty_of_london: "The Treaty of London"
 je_treaty_of_london_reason: "The territories of the newly established Belgian state have been poorly defined since its independence was established in the Belgian Revolution. If we fail to assert our position as more than a mere buffer state to our neighboring powers, we risk losing the land disputed with the Netherlands."

 low_countries_events.2.d: "With the aftermath of the Luxembourg Crisis we have solidified our position as the leading partner of a personal union with Luxembourg as well as the primary territorial owner of Limburg."
 low_countries_events.2.f: "Since the first treaty of London the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has existed in a peculiar position. While being a de jure personal union of the Netherlands, Luxembourg has continued to exist in the German customs union while boasting some of the largest fortresses in Europe. Given both French and German interest in the region it has become inevitable that neutrality is established. In this Second Treaty of London the neutrality of Luxembourg, reaffirmed as a junior partner in personal union with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, will continue to exist while Limburg is an integral part of the realm."

 low_countries_events.1.f: "Ever since the Belgian Revolution in 1830 saw the establishment of our Belgian nation, we have experienced unabated conflict with our northern neighbor. However, since the ten days' campaign in 1831, it has been made clear that militarily we are no match to the Dutch and that our current existence is dependent on neighboring powers. With the Dutch previously not accepting any peace treaty involving us, the current London Conference has taken place which seeks to reach a compromise with the Netherlands by returning their claims on northern Limburg and eastern Luxembourg while we remain a neutral buffer state."

 #larantuka_purchase: "Sell Sovereign Rights of Larantuka to the Netherlands"
 #larantuka_purchase_desc: "While we have maintained a tributary relationship with the kingdom of Larantuka since the early 1600s, with the decline of the sandalwood trade the island now shows little prospect.

 #low_countries_events.5.f: "Since the early 1600s the Portuguese have held the Catholic kingdom of Larantuka as a tributary for the profits from the local sandalwood. Despite several military attempts over the centuries for us to seize the islands, we have never been successful. With the decline of the sandalwood trade and Portuguese interest in the region with it, they wish to sell us rights to the island."
