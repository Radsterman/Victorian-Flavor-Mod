 low_countries_events.2.f:0 "Since the first treaty of London the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has existed in a peculiar position. While being a de jure personal union of the Netherlands, Luxembourg has continued to exist in the German customs union while boasting some of the largest fortresses in Europe. Given both French and German interest in the region it has become inevitable that neutrality is established. In this Second Treaty of London the neutrality of Luxembourg, rearfirmed as a junior partner in personal union with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, will continue to exist while Limburg is an integral part of the realm."

However, since the Ten days' campaign in 1831 it has been made clear that militarily we are no match to the Dutch for the time being and our current existence is dependent on neighboring powers. With the Dutch previously not accepting any peace treaty involving us the current London Conference has taken place which seeks to reach a compromise with the Netherlands by returning their claims on northern Limburg and eastern Luxembourg while we remain a neutral buffer state."
