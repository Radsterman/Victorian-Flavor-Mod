 ottoman_dynasty.1.t:0 "The Death of Mahmud II"
 ottoman_dynasty.1.d:0 "Mahmud II passed away today after a long battle with tuberculosis, attended by his physicians, advisors, consorts and family. He leaves the throne in the hands of Abdulmecid as a capable successor. Born the youngest son of Abdulhamid, he came to the throne at only 13 after surviving an attempted assassination. His reign marked a period of territorial decline with the loss of Greece and Serbia, but also the beginnings of change with the destruction of the Janissaries. He is survived by his heir and the new Sultan, Abdulmejid, his other son Abdulaziz and three daughters."
 ottoman_dynasty.1.f:0 "Sultan Mahmud-u sani, Caliph of all Islam, Commander of the Faithful, Hadimu'l-Haremeyn, Sultan of the two Lands, the Khan of the Seas, the Sultan son of the Sultan is forever victorious."

Following in the footsteps of his father Mahmud II, as Sultan he pushed for reforms to modernize the state and military and spoke well of the need maintain the unity and integrity of the Empire in this new century. His brother and heir, Abdulaziz, has ordered that he be interred in the Yavuz Selim Mosque alongside Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent. He is survived by numerous sons and daughters, having taken one of the largest harems in the Empire's history."

 je_sick_man_vilayets:0 "Tanzimat: Organization of the Vilayets"
 je_sick_man_vilayets_reason:0 "The old system of Eyalets has served its purpose and must now be reformed, with the title of 'Vali' replacing the previous 'Beylerbey' and new, defined and regularized system of responsibilities that will ensure all regions of our state are run along the same lines."
 
 je_sick_man_navy:0 "Tanzimat: Naval Reform"
 je_sick_man_navy_reason:0 "The navy has been long-neglected and is a hotbed of disloyalty. During our early wars with our rebellious vassal Muhammad Ali Pasha our navy threatened to defect to the Egyptians multiple times, and we are forced to rely on the support of foreign powers to defend our coasts and the straits. Renovating the navy by developing our officer corps, fielding new detachments and outfitting new, larger ships must be a priority."
 
 je_druze_christian_war_foreign:0 "Conflict in the Lebanon"
 je_druze_christian_war_foreign_reason:0 "Our interests in the Middle East mean that we must keep a close eye on the situation in Lebanon as it escalates to open conflict between the different religious communities there. Perhaps we can turn this to our advantage?"

 vilayet_events.1.t:0 "Reorganization of the Provinces"
 vilayet_events.1.d:0 "With our much-needed administrative reform effort we have been able to reduce the extent of corruption and organize a proper system of duties for our provincial governors. We shall drag ourselves kicking and screaming into the 19th century!"
 vilayet_events.1.f:0 "'Beneath the Vali is the Mufettichi-Hukkiami or chief magistrate, the Muhasebeci in charge of finances, the Mektubcu in charge of post and the Defter-i Hakani Muduru who- it's probably easier if I just draw you a picture'"
 vilayet_events.1.a:0 "Bit by bit, we chip away at past."
 
 vilayet_events.2.t:0 "Bringing Egypt To Heel"
 vilayet_events.2.d:0 "Driving the Egyptian armies from Syria and returning the Levant to the Sultan's control has put us in an advantageous position against the rebellious Ali Pasha, nonetheless if we wish to fully reassert control over Egypt we face a difficult campaign through Sinai and into the Nile Valley. If we wished to avoid this, we could instead offer to confirm him as legitimate ruler of Egypt and make this office hereditary. As an added sweetener, we might afford him the honorary title "Khedive". This would place him above the rest of the Ottoman nobility, affording him the dignity of a vassal king."
 vilayet_events.2.f:0 "His Highness the Sultan has the intention to grant and to cause to be notified to Muhammed Ali the conditions of the arrangement here below: I. His Highness promises to grant to M. Ali, for himself and his descendants in direct line, the administration of the Pashalic of Egypt, and His Highness promises, furthermore..."
 vilayet_events.2.a:0 "Egypt remains important, offer him the position and title."
 vilayet_events.2.b:0 "This upstart may serve as vali, nothing more."
 vilayet_events.2.c:0 "We will settle for nothing less than conquest"
 vilayet_events.2.tta:0 "Egypt will become our Dominion, with the special ruler title of "Khedive". They will like this offer!"
 vilayet_events.2.ttb:0 "Egypt will become our Puppet, with no special status afforded them. This will insult them!"
 
 vilayet_events.3.t:0 "The Khedivate of Egypt?"
 vilayet_events.3.d:0 "After the disastrous loss of Syria to the Sultan's armies we have received diplomatic overtures from Constantinople. It seems that, in league with the western powers backing him, the Sultan means to offer us an accord. In exchange for annual tribute from our tax revenues and our formal submission to his authority, the dynasty of Muhammad Ali shall be permitted to maintain hereditary rule over Egypt and to function effectively as an autonomous vassal kingdom, whose ruler bears the title Khedive."
 vilayet_events.3.f:0 "V. All the treaties and all the laws of the Ottoman Empire shall be applied to Egypt and to the Pashalic of Acre, such as it has been hereabove designated, the same as to every other part of the Ottoman Empire. But the Sultan consents that, upon the condition of the regular payment of the above-named tribute, M. Ali and his descendants do gather in the name of the Sultan, and as delegates of His Highness throughout the provinces whose administration shall be to them entrusted."
 vilayet_events.3.a:0 "Let the Sultan know we accept this offer"
 vilayet_events.3.b:0 "Give no answer, we refuse this treaty"
 
 vilayet_events.4.t:0 "The Vilayet of Egypt?"
 vilayet_events.4.d:0 "After the disastrous loss of Syria to the Sultan's armies we have received diplomatic overtures from Constantinople. It seems that, in league with the western powers backing him, the Sultan means to offer us an accord. In exchange for annual tribute from our tax revenues and our formal submission to his authority, the dynasty of Muhammad Ali shall be permitted to maintain hereditary rule over Egypt and pass down the role of provincial governor to his descendants. However no special status is afforded them, an affront to their power and dignity."
 vilayet_events.4.f:0 "V. All the treaties and all the laws of the Ottoman Empire shall be applied to Egypt and to the Pashalic of Acre, such as it has been hereabove designated, the same as to every other part of the Ottoman Empire. But the Sultan consents that, upon the condition of the regular payment of the above-named tribute, M.

 vilayet_events.4.b:0 "Give no answer, we refuse this treaty"
 
 vilayet_events.5.t:0 "Egypt Submits"
 vilayet_events.5.d:0 "Be it out of fear or conscience, Egypt has submitted to us. We are most pleased with this outcome, and must now begin the hard work of reasserting out authority over Arabia."
 vilayet_events.5.f:0 "His prompt compliance with the orders of his sovereign, according to previous arrangement, has been agreeable to His Highness, who takes pleasure in giving proof of his kindly feelings by treating all his servants with perfect consideration, and who, considering the past events as having never existed, has deigned to grant a generous pardon to Muhammed Ali Pasha"
 vilayet_events.5.a:0 "Splendid"
 
 vilayet_events.6.t:0 "Egypt Refuses"
 vilayet_events.6.d:0 "No reply has come from Alexandria to our generous offer, as such we are now forced to review our options with respect to the Egyptian question. It seems that if we wish to bring Egypt back into the fold then military force will be our only choice."
 vilayet_events.6.f:0 "His noncompliance with the orders of his sovereign, according to previous arrangement, has been offensive to His Highness, who takes great joy in the prosecution of those who trespass against him and God, and who, considering the past events, has commanded his armies to put down the rebel Muhammed Ali Pasha"
 vilayet_events.6.a:0 "How dare they"
 vilayet_events.6.b:0 "Unfortunate"
 
 vilayet_events.7.t: "Centralizing the Kurdish Regions"
 vilayet_events.7.d: "The proper governance of the realm concerns the Sultan greatly, as he would be seen as a wise and benevolent protector of the people. While the rights and privileges of the Kurdish Emirs were guaranteed in the aftermath of war with the [PER.GetName] in order to ensure their loyalty times have changed. A modern state requires a modern concept of territorial sovereignty, incompatible with the tribal organization of the Kurds and their feudal relationship with the Porte, as such we must restrict their territory and remove their autonomy."
 vilayet_events.7.f: "It is therefore with a glad heart and joyous tidings that the Sultan issues this firman to the Mirs of the tribe, inviting them to take up appointment under his Vali and thereby enrich the administration of the provinces"
 vilayet_events.7.a: "[SCOPE.sCountry('kurdish_annexation_target_state_1').GetName] will be reformed."
 vilayet_events.7.b: "[SCOPE.sCountry('kurdish_annexation_target_state_2').GetName] requires our attention."
 vilayet_events.7.c: "[SCOPE.sCountry('kurdish_annexation_target_state_3').GetName] must take priority."
 
 vilayet_events.8.t: "Creating a Kurdistan Vilayet"
 vilayet_events.8.d: "The Kurdish Emirs have long resisted centralization and treated the Sultan more as an ally than a ruler. It may have suited us to entertain their internal feuds and raiding while our attention was on conquest and wars and their mountain homes inaccessible but times have changed, we will organize our Kurdish vassals into a single autonomous province and grant them limited self-rule in order to rationalize and reform the administration of the region, compelling them to unite under one ruler."
 vilayet_events.8.f: "In his wisdom, the Sultan confers upon the tribes of the mountains this grant of governance, and decrees that they be governed hence as the following three provinces..."
 vilayet_events.8.a: "The Sultan is wide indeed."

 
 tanzimat_events.11.t: "Tensions Around Mt Lebanon"
 tanzimat_events.11.f: "'From the wounds I have seen, both on the living and the dead, it would appear that the assassins went to work with the most systematic cruelty; ten, twelve, and fourteen deep cuts on the body of a person are not infrequent"
 tanzimat_events.11.d: "Troubling reports are reaching us from the local government in Lebanon, ever since the region was reclaimed from the Egyptian army we have kept matters under control by deposing the Shihab Emir and appointing a Pasha to govern the region, but a conflict seems to be brewing between the insular Druze community and the large Maronite Christian population. What began as simple peasant unrest over harsh tax burdens, with Maronite peasants rising up against Christian and Druze lords alike, has swiftly turned into a communal conflict with sporadic fighting breaking out between Druze and Maronite men in local villages. There are rumors that militia are being armed and that matters may soon escalate..."
 tanzimat_events.11.a: "Surely our local forces have it in hand?"
 
 tanzimat_events.12.t: "Massacres In Lebanon"
 tanzimat_events.12.f: "'The battle raged till sunset, the Christians keeping their enemies at bay, and inflicting on them a considerable loss; upwards of one hundred were killed besides large numbers of wounded. They themselves only lost twelve. Several Turkish soldiers belonging to the garrison fought in the Druze ranks.'"
 tanzimat_events.12.d: "Terrible news has arrived regarding the situation around Mount Lebanon, spurred on by local leaders and supported by our own local garrisons in the region, the Druze of Mount Lebanon have won a series of victories against the Maronite Christians and have begun large-scale massacres and plunder of Christian villages. We seemingly cannot rely on our local forces at all, and foreign consulates are sending word home of our failure to protect their coreligionists. This has the potential to escalate into a complete disaster."
 tanzimat_events.12.a: "We have Kurdish irregulars nearby."
 tanzimat_events.12.b: "Reinforce the local garrisons."
 
 tanzimat_events.13.t:0 "Our Forces Join the Druze"
 tanzimat_events.13.d:0 "Disaster! It seems the local forces we dispatched to Mount Lebanon in an effort to quell the conflict have decided that this meant joining the Druze troops as they rampaged through the countryside, burning villages and slaughtering the inhabitants. Many thousands of Christians have now fled to Damascus or Beirut where they are encamped in great poverty, and much has been looted or destroyed."
 tanzimat_events.13.f:0 "It is hard to run a country when you can't trust your own army, does this mean we should abandon the reforms and simply accept that the Zimmi are second class citizens, or indicate their necessity?"
 tanzimat_events.13.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 
 tanzimat_events.14.t:0 "Refugee Tension in Damascus"
 tanzimat_events.14.d:0 "Ever since the massacres around Mount Lebanon, thousands of refugees have been camped in Damascus. When the news of the fall of Christian strongholds in the area arrived it is claimed that there were celebrations in the streets by the Muslims of the city, overjoyed at the humbling of their arrogant neighbors. Anecdotes of abuse suffered by the local population; houses defaced and roads painted with crosses, abuse in the street and harassment in the markets have increased and many are tense, worried that there will be blood in Damascus too."
 tanzimat_events.14.f:0 "According to the latest news from Beyrout, the state of things in Syria continues to be of the gravest character"
 tanzimat_events.14.a:0 "Prepare to mobilize the army."
 
 tanzimat_events.15.t:0 "Damascene Massacres"
 tanzimat_events.15.d:0 "Tensions between the Muslims and Christians in Damascus, inflamed by the influx of Christian refugees, have erupted into rioting upon the attempted arrest of two young boys for vandalizing the road in a Christian neighborhood. Matters have escalated beyond the ability of the local police to control with a thousands-strong mob roaming the streets killing any Christians they find, looting and burning their property. We have prepared the regular army to mobilize and restore order to the region, it now just remains to choose who will lead them."
 tanzimat_events.15.f:0 "You do not go to make war against any foreign power, but to assist the Sultan in bringing back the obedience of his subjects."

 tanzimat_events.16.d:0 "After a year in action [SCOPE.sCharacter('lebanon_pacifier').GetFullName] has managed to disarm the warring groups in Lebanon and restore some semblance of order. The local garrison commanders have been replaced and where possible looted property has been returned to its owners. The long-term damage to the Christian population will take time to recover, but for now we have shown we are still capable of keeping order in our own house."
 tanzimat_events.16.f:0 "Thousands dead and many more displaced, but houses can be rebuilt and crops resown. Can we ever bring back trust and harmony between the people?"
 tanzimat_events.16.a:0 "Praise God for his mercy!"
 
 
 opda_events.1.t:0 "The Ottoman Public Debt Administration"
 opda_events.1.d:0 "Formed by our creditors as a means to ensure that we pay back our loans, the OPDA is a body with sweeping powers to collect taxes and remit payment back to investors who fear for the stability of Ottoman government bonds."
