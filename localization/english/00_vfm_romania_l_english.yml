  je_unify_romania: "Unite the Romanian Principalities"
  je_unify_romania_status: "Peacefully unite with our neighbors"
  je_unify_romania_reason: "Despite the objections of the great powers, who see Romanian nationalism as a threat to their interests, in practice if there is an accord between our governments and people then it will become a fiat accompli. By drawing close to our neighbour and coordinating with them we can gradually tie the principalities together."
  je_unify_romania_goal: "Maintain $relations_amicable$ relations with Wallachia/Moldavia for 5 years"
