  safavid_empire_special_tooltip: "The Safavid Empire was the pre-eminent power that ruled much of Iran from the 16th to 18th centuries. Founded by Shāh Ismāʻil I in 1501, the Safavids, with help of the Qizilbash Turkmen, would come to conquer the remnants of the Timurid Empire, as well as the then prevalent Aq Qoyunlu Confederation that ruled much of Western Iran.\n\nOften seen as a resurgent Persian Empire of old, the Safavids were the main driving force behind the conversation of Iran to Shiite Islam and brought about a renaissance of culture, the arts and economic activity through its stabilizing force.\n\nThe Savafids were the main rivals for the Ottomans and Bukharans for much of their existence until the rise of the Afghan Hotak Dynasty. Following the ensuing chaos, Nader Shah would shortly restore the Safavids as rulers over all of Iran before crowning himself Shah in 1736.\n\nWith the death of Nader Shah, Iran would once again see itself divided between various states and dynasties until the rise of the Zands and eventually the Qajars in 1789."

  durrani_empire_special_tooltip: "The Durrani Empire was formed in the aftermath of Nader Shah’s death in 1747 when the short-lived Afsharid Empire fractured into a variety of de facto warlord states.\n\nIn the east of the former empire, Ahmad Shah Durrani, from the Pashtun Abdali tribe, rose to prominence and established an empire of his own which would come to encompass much of Afghanistan, Khorasan, Beluchistan, Punjab and Sindh.\n\nOften regarded as the truly first modern Afghan state along with the very short-lived Hotak Dynasty, the Durrani Empire came to define much of Afghanistan for centuries to come by establishing a common state for the Pashtuns.\n\nIt’s fortunes have turned recently however as the assassination of the realm's Vizier Fateh Khan in 1823 caused his brothers from the Barakzai tribe to carve up the realm into a variety of principalities, exiling the Durrani to the city of Herat which has since then fallen into the Qajar sphere."

  frca_1826_civil_war_special_tooltip: "The Central American Civil War raged from 1826 until 1829 between the forces of Manuel José Arce, the conservative President who ruled following the declaration of independence, and Francisco Morazán, the current President of the FRCA.\n\nHaving formerly been a Liberal himself, Arce would dissolve the liberal assembly in 1826 and ally himself with the Conservatives following the loss of support by his own party. His alliance with the clergy and replacement of the then liberal government of Guatemala with a conservative one caused widespread unrest in San Salvador, triggering a liberal revolt in the province. When attempting to coup the Honduran government, Morazán would lead the defense and inadvertently escalate the conflict that would rage until 1829.\n\nWhile Arce was brought down and Morazán managed to temporarily reunite the fracturing nation, the war has left deep wounds that continue to threaten the unity of the republic to this day."

  frca_1834_elections_special_tooltip: "Morazán has led the nation in a dictatorial way since the overthrow of Arce. A staunch liberal reformer, Morazán has implemented a strict secularization policy, consolidated liberal rule in San Salvador, and even replaced conservative governments in the provinces with liberal ones, causing widespread reactionary backlash.\n\nEven within his own camp, the radicality of his reforms leave many worried and this manifested in the 1834 presidential elections which Morazán lost to José Cecilio del Valle. José, who promised to reconcile the conservative and liberal factions, would die just prior to accepting his mandate. His untimely death thus caused Morazán to be sworn in for a second term, causing many conservatives to abandon hope for the union and to increasingly seek separation. "
