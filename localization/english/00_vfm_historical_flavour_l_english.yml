  safavid_empire_special_tooltip: "The Safavid Empire was the pre-eminent power that ruled much of Iran from the 16th to 18th centuries. Founded by Shāh Ismāʻil I in 1501, the Safavids, with help of the Qizilbash Turkmen, would come to conquer the remnants of the Timurid Empire, as well as the then prevalent Aq Qoyunlu Confederation that ruled much of Western Iran.\n\nOften seen as a resurgent Persian Empire of old, the Safavids were the main driving force behind the conversation of Iran to Shiite Islam and brought about a renaissance of culture, the arts and economic activity through its stabilizing force.\n\nThe Savafids were the main rivals for the Ottomans and Bukharans for much of their existence until the rise of the Afghan Hotak Dynasty. Following the ensuing chaos, Nader Shah would shortly restore the Safavids as rulers over all of Iran before crowning himself Shah in 1736.\n\nWith the death of Nader Shah, Iran would once again see itself divided between various states and dynasties until the rise of the Zands and eventually the Qajars in 1789."

  durrani_empire_special_tooltip: "The Durrani Empire was formed in the aftermath of Nader Shah’s death in 1747 when the short-lived Afsharid Empire fractured into a variety of de facto warlord states.\n\nIn the east of the former empire, Ahmad Shah Durrani, from the Pashtun Abdali tribe, rose to prominence and established an empire of his own which would come to encompass much of Afghanistan, Khorasan, Beluchistan, Punjab and Sindh.\n\nOften regarded as the truly first modern Afghan state along with the very short-lived Hotak Dynasty, the Durrani Empire came to define much of Afghanistan for centuries to come by establishing a common state for the Pashtuns.\n\nIt’s fortunes have turned recently however as the assassination of the realm's Vizier Fateh Khan in 1823 caused his brothers from the Barakzai tribe to carve up the realm into a variety of principalities, exiling the Durrani to the city of Herat which has since then fallen into the Qajar sphere."
