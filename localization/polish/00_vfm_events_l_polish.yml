	peru_bolivia_confederation.1.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('pes_scope').GetNameNoFlag] has submerged [SCOPE.sCountry('peu_scope').GetNameNoFlag] in anarchy. General Gamarra's simultaneous march on the city of Cuzco has put President [SCOPE.sCountry('peu_scope').GetRuler.GetFullName] in a precarious position."
	peru_bolivia_confederation.1.f: "The latest chapter in this tragic tale has seen President [SCOPE.sCountry('peu_scope').GetRuler.GetFullName]'s government reduced to controlling only the city of Arequipa. Threatened from the north by [SCOPE.sCountry('pes_scope').GetRuler.GetFullName], former general inspector of the militias and now self-proclaimed Supreme Chief of the Republic, and from the south by General Gamarra, who after planing along with President [SCOPE.sCountry('bol_scope').GetRuler.GetFullName] to take advantage of the dire situation in Peru and take control over it's territory to fulfill their mutual dream of establishing a union between Peru and Bolivia, decided to march and take Cuzco before the support for his invasion was oficially ratified by the Bolivian goverment. \n\n[SCOPE.sCountry('peu_scope').GetRuler.GetFullName], overwhelmed by the situation and unaware of the dealings betwen [SCOPE.sCountry('bol_scope').GetRuler.GetLastName] and Gamarra, received permission from congress to ask [SCOPE.sCountry('bol_scope').GetNameNoFlag] to save him in exchange for allowing [SCOPE.sCountry('bol_scope').GetRuler.GetLastName] to form a confederation between [SCOPE.sCountry('peu_scope').GetNameNoFlag] and [SCOPE.sCountry('bol_scope').GetNameNoFlag] on his terms.\n\nThus, a little less than a year after the coup, the Bolivian army and the [SCOPE.sCountry('peu_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] forces loyal to [SCOPE.sCountry('peu_scope').GetRuler.GetLastName] have turned the tables. Gamarra is in exile after a shameful defeat on the battlefield and the territory controlled by [SCOPE.sCountry('pes_scope').GetRuler.GetLastName] is limited to Arequipa and the Real Felipe fortress in Callao."

The southern populations have long lived in discontent, feeling subordinated to Lima's elites. This, together with the historical, geographical, and cultural separation from the north, has generated ideas of independence."
	peru_bolivia_confederation.3.f: "Now, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], a man of both Hispanic and Inca noble descent, has become a celebrity among [SCOPE.sCountry('peu_scope').GetNameNoFlag]'s underprivileged classes, his fame only growing stronger as you approach the [SCOPE.sCountry('peu_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] south. The yearning for independence has been amalgamated with the popularity of the confederation project with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag] not only amongst the general population but also notables such as the influential cleric Luna Pizarro.\n\n"It is only fair to free them from the tyranny of Lima! … Besides, they would be a good ally if things ever go south with the north."\n\n"Haven't you heard of self-fulfilling prophecies!?

	peru_bolivia_confederation.7.f: "The Confederation's government will work in a similar way to the relationship between state governments and the federal government of the [SCOPE.sCountry('usa_scope').GetNameNoFlag], but granting significant powers to the executive branch of the general government among which is a 10-year term with the possibility of immediate re-election for the Protector.\n\nBeing [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] the first Protector, he will have the task of consolidating the Confederation and defending it from her enemies to ensure that after his mandate is over, she stands established like any other state and not just a feeble relationship between countries."
